# Enhancing-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-with-Transfer-Learning-and-Explainable-AI

Motivation: In medical imaging, obtaining large, labeled datasets is often challenging due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and limited availability of expert knowledge. To effectively learn and boost performance on these smaller datasets, we leverage transfer learning techniques, which consist of models that are trained on huge amounts of data.

Goal: Improve the performance of diabetic retinopathy detection using transfer learning by fine-tuning models and understanding the classification results with visualizations and explainable AI.
